# Surface Pro 5 not shutting down. Issue also found in SP 9.
# workaround: https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Intel-12th-Generation-Devices-Issues#s5-acpi-shutdown-or-regular-shutdown-does-not-work
https://github.com/linux-surface/kernel/commit/6f57d3f0780712e9b6cea1ee3b87605d2920e8ae

# Step 1: Identify your current kernel version
uname -r

# Step 2: Ensure your system is up-to-date
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Step 3: Clone the Linux kernel source
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux

# Step 4: Checkout your current kernel version
# Replace X.Y.Z with your kernel version (e.g., v5.15)
git checkout vX.Y.Z

# Step 5: Download and apply the patch from the GitHub commit page
# First, save the patch file locally, then apply it
git apply /path/to/patchfile.patch

# Step 6: Configure the kernel (interactive step)
make menuconfig

# Step 7: Compile and install the new kernel (this will take time)
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install

# Step 8: Update the bootloader to recognize the new kernel
sudo update-grub

# Step 9: Reboot to apply changes
sudo reboot

#Confirm with ok/yes and when asked for a password enter surface.

update-grub

#Finally, reboot your system and you should boot into the linux-surface kernel. Please make sure you are actually using the right kernel by checking if the output of uname -a contains the string surface.
#If it doesn't contain that string, you are still using the default kernel and need to configure your bootloader.

#Still not shutting down

#Update GRUB and reboot:
nano /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=force"
update-grub
# 11/7/24 didn't seem to help the situation

#shutdown list
shutdown now
poweroff
halt
init 0
systemctl poweroff

#if none worked
#identify open processes
sudo lsof | grep DEL

#kill processes then shutdown
sudo pkill -u $USER
sudo shutdown now

#additional
sudo shutdown -h now acpi=force


# More Troubleshooting Steps for Linux Mint Shutdown Issue on Surface Pro

# 1. Force Filesystem Check on Reboot
# Run the following commands to force a filesystem check on reboot.
# Filesystem corruption can sometimes cause shutdown issues.
sudo touch /forcefsck
sudo reboot

# 2. Update the Kernel
# Sometimes, shutdown issues are related to kernel compatibility with hardware.
# Updating to the latest stable Linux kernel may resolve the issue.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-generic

# Reboot to apply the new kernel, then try shutting down again.

# 3. Examine Boot Logs for Errors
# Reviewing logs may reveal if specific processes or hardware components are hanging.
# Run this command to view logs from the last boot attempt.
sudo journalctl -b -1

# Look for any error messages near the end of the log.

# 4. Check for Incomplete SystemD Shutdown Targets
# If SystemD targets are failing, they might prevent shutdown.
# Use this command to check for any stuck jobs.
systemctl list-jobs

# If you find any stuck jobs, you may need to force-stop them individually.

# 5. Attempt Power Off from the SysRq Interface (Hardware-Level Shutdown)
# The SysRq (Magic SysRq) key sequence works directly with the kernel
# and bypasses most processes to force a shutdown.
# Hold Alt + SysRq (Print Screen), then press O to power off the system.

# 6. Reinstall Power Management Packages
# If power management components are corrupted or incompatible,
# reinstalling them can sometimes resolve shutdown issues.
sudo apt install --reinstall acpi acpid
sudo systemctl restart acpid

# Try shutting down again after reinstalling the packages.

# 7. Check for ACPI Compatibility in GRUB Configuration
# Modify ACPI settings to work better with your device.
# Edit the GRUB config file as follows:
sudo nano /etc/default/grub

# Find the line that begins with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
# and add acpi=force or acpi=off as shown below:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=force"

# Save the file, update GRUB, and reboot:
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot

# Notes:
# If none of these steps resolve the shutdown issue, it may indicate
# a deeper compatibility issue specific to Linux on Surface Pro.
