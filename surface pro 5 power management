#Finally, reboot your system and you should boot into the linux-surface kernel. Please make sure you are actually using the right kernel by checking if the output of uname -a contains the string surface.
#If it doesn't contain that string, you are still using the default kernel and need to configure your bootloader.

# More Troubleshooting Steps for Linux Mint Shutdown Issue on Surface Pro

# 1. Force Filesystem Check on Reboot
# Run the following commands to force a filesystem check on reboot.
# Filesystem corruption can sometimes cause shutdown issues.
sudo touch /forcefsck
sudo reboot

# 2. Update the Kernel
# Sometimes, shutdown issues are related to kernel compatibility with hardware.
# Updating to the latest stable Linux kernel may resolve the issue.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-generic

# Reboot to apply the new kernel, then try shutting down again.

# 3. Examine Boot Logs for Errors
# Reviewing logs may reveal if specific processes or hardware components are hanging.
# Run this command to view logs from the last boot attempt.
sudo journalctl -b -1

# Look for any error messages near the end of the log.

# 4. Check for Incomplete SystemD Shutdown Targets
# If SystemD targets are failing, they might prevent shutdown.
# Use this command to check for any stuck jobs.
systemctl list-jobs

# If you find any stuck jobs, you may need to force-stop them individually.

# 5. Attempt Power Off from the SysRq Interface (Hardware-Level Shutdown)
# The SysRq (Magic SysRq) key sequence works directly with the kernel
# and bypasses most processes to force a shutdown.
# Hold Alt + SysRq (Print Screen), then press O to power off the system.

# 6. Reinstall Power Management Packages
# If power management components are corrupted or incompatible,
# reinstalling them can sometimes resolve shutdown issues.
sudo apt install --reinstall acpi acpid
sudo systemctl restart acpid

# Try shutting down again after reinstalling the packages.

# 7. Check for ACPI Compatibility in GRUB Configuration
# Modify ACPI settings to work better with your device.
# Edit the GRUB config file as follows:
sudo nano /etc/default/grub

# Find the line that begins with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
# and add acpi=force or acpi=off as shown below:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=force"

# Save the file, update GRUB, and reboot:
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot

# Notes:
# If none of these steps resolve the shutdown issue, it may indicate
# a deeper compatibility issue specific to Linux on Surface Pro.
