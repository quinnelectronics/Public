# Instructions to Deploy the Firefox Stack in Portainer

# 1. Open Portainer.
# 2. Click **Stacks** in the left sidebar.
# 3. Click **Add stack** at the top-right.
# 4. Name the stack: firefox
# 5. Paste the above Docker Compose YAML into the stack editor.
# 6. Click **Deploy the stack**.
# 7. Wait for the container to be created and started.

# Accessing Firefox
# 1. Open a web browser and navigate to http://<your-server-ip>:5800.
# 2. You will see a web-based VNC window with Firefox running inside.

# Notes
# - If you want to change the port, update `5800:5800` to another port (like 5900) to avoid conflicts.
# - You can change the display resolution by editing `DISPLAY_WIDTH` and `DISPLAY_HEIGHT`.
# - The Firefox profile (history, bookmarks, etc.) will be stored in `/robo-docker/containers/firefox`, so your data will persist.
